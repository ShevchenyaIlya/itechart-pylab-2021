# iTechArt Python labs 2021

Every folder consists of files that solve tasks represented in laboratory works.

## Tasks

- [x] Python script using the Beautiful Soup library to collect data from www.reddit.com for posts in the 
Top -> This Month category.

- [x] Parser data is not saved directly to a file, but through a separate RESTful service available at 
http://localhost:8087/, which in turn provides a simple API for working with basic file operations.

- [ ] Additional challenge: implement parallel post processing using asyncio.
